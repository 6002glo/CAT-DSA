## 2. Arrays and Linked Lists
 
 ### Memory Allocation
 
 * **Arrays:** Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. 
 * **Linked Lists:** Elements are stored in non-contiguous memory locations using dynamic memory allocation. 
 
 ### Performance
 
 * **Arrays:** Provide faster access to elements by index (O(1)). 
 * **Linked Lists:** Accessing elements requires traversal, resulting in O(n) access time. 
 
 ### Insertion
 
 * **Arrays:** Insertion in the middle is time-consuming (O(n)). 
 * **Linked Lists:** Insertion at the front is fast (O(1)) if the node pointer is available.
